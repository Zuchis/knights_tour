My implementation of the knight's tour problem - both sequential and parallel

The algorithm used is the [Warnsdorf's rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour#Warnsdorf.27s_rule), combined
with the tiebraking rules [proposed by Douglas Squirrel](http://math.oregonstate.edu/~math_reu/proceedings/REU_Proceedings/Proceedings1996/1996Squirrel.pdf).
